This project was carried out by Olakunle Adegeye using a dataset obtained
from a survey of professionals in the data field.
The objective of the project was to gather enough insight to
serve as a guideline for both for aspiring and incumbent data professionals for
understanding the industry and what it takes to break into a chosen field.


In this project, I showcased my skills in some areas in data analysis such as
Microsoft SQL, PowerBI, Tableau, Power Query, DAX, Excel, data reporting,
analytical thinking,organization, communication, and presentation skills.
