### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A descriptive research was carried out amongst data professionals to understand various aspects about the profession such as the average salary, most preferred programming language, ease of transitioning to the field, among other questions. The major objective of the analysis was to better inform aspiring data professionals about the profession with respect to the effort and reward.<br/>

Data Scientist, Data Engineers, Data Analysts, Data Architects, Database Developers comprised majority of the respondents and purposive sampling was used to select a number of social media platforms for the distribution of the survey form. Data was collected using an online survey form and the responses were downloaded as a spreadsheet file.<br/>

Data cleaning, transformation and summarization was done using various tools such as Microsoft SQL Server, DAX functions and Power Query, and Microsoft Excel.
The results of the data were presented in a dashboard view using Tableau and PowerBI. This was done to showcase my proficiency with both BI solutions. The links to the interactive PowerBI dashboard can be accessed by clicking HERE, while the link to the Tableau dashboard can be accessed HERE. Static summaries of the dashboards were also provided towards the end of this report.<br/>

The result of the analysis revealed that Data Scientist made the most money compared to other data professionals with an average salary of $93,800. This resonates with other industry analysis carried out using job boards such as Glassdoor and Indeed. The Finance sector was discovered to be the most lucrative sector according to the analysis. Python was chosen as the most preferred programming language with 67% of the respondents preferring it over other programming languages. 72% of responses as regards transitioning into the field ranged between ‘very easy’ and ‘neither easy nor difficult’. Nevertheless, the satisfaction with salary in the field came in at 4.27 out of a total score of 10.<br/>

The research had certain limitations: majority of the responses were from Data Analyst. SQL was excluded from the list of languages, and the report did not cover the entire breadth of the analysis possible.<br/>
It is advised that anyone interested in the information or considering transitioning into a profession in data should interact with the dashboard to fully understand the analysis.<br/>
